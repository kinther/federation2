### Version log

1.0 "Deficit Dance" - Initial release.  Runs through deficit loop cycle.

1.1 "Anomalous Alloys" - bug fixes in deficit loop logic, minor enhancements
to print further data to logfile, conversion of user/password passing to
command line arguments rather than static entries in script, and some PEP8
updates.

1.2 "BBQ BioChips" - cargo bay checks/notifications, script will now exit
if run by character below Founder rank, script will exit when character is not
on their home planet when started, home planet is now passed from command line,
deficits not accounted for in planets.json will be skipped, and fixed a
timestamp error on Windows preventing script from running.

1.3 "Bargain BioComponents" - fix exchange parsing issue caused by recent
update and improve script speed by decreasing time.sleep in most cases.

1.4 "Celestial Cereals" - support for multiple planets in your system

2.0 "Surplus Shuffle" - adds support for selling surpluses to remote planets
with the --mode parameter (allows either "deficit" or "surplus").  Defaults
to deficit if not specified.

2.1 "Clandestine Clays" - adds checks on whether a remote exchange is selling
a commodity and if that is above a certain threshold, improvements to the jump
system routine to reduce extra jumps, rank is checked only once instead of
every iteration, and improvements to logging.

2.1.1 "Clandestine Clays" - hotfix to resolve company name conflicting with
planet name issue.

2.2 "Smuggled Semiconductors" - deficits are now checked before leaving planet
to purchase them (this should ensure if someone sold to your planet you don't
also try to sell, thereby buying commodities for no reason), food/fuel will
be bought more often, added numerous try/except blocks to improve script
runtime, and fixed the parsing of exchange data so that it sees less
ValueError or IndexError exceptions.

2.3 "LanzariK Lozenges" - altered exception handling to print exceptions to the
logfile, improved verbosity when the checkIfSelling function is used and the
remote exchange is below a certain threshold, updated README with more info on
how to run the script, and added more logic to end of each iteration so that
if a user is not on the expected planet the script will exit (thus ensuring
something bad doesn't happen like dying) or if there are extra tons in the
cargo hold the script will not continuously buy more and waste money.  closed
out old WinError issue which appears to be due to my old crappy wifi router,
not an actual bug in the code.
