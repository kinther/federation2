### Version log

1.0 "Deficit Dance" - Initial release
- Runs through deficit loop cycle.

1.1 "Anomalous Alloys" 
- Bug fixes in deficit loop logic.
- Minor enhancements to print further data to logfile.
- Conversion of user/password passing to command line arguments rather than
static entries in script.
- Some PEP8 updates.

1.2 "BBQ BioChips"
- Cargo bay checks/notifications.
- Script will now exit if run by character below Founder rank.
- Script will exit when character is not on their home planet when started.
- Home planet is now passed from command line.
- Deficits not accounted for in planets.json will be skipped.
- Fixed a timestamp error on Windows preventing script from running.

1.3 "Bargain BioComponents"
- Fix exchange parsing issue caused by recent update and improve script speed
by decreasing time.sleep in most cases.

1.4 "Celestial Cereals"
- Support for multiple planets in your system.

2.0 "Surplus Shuffle" - Major release
- Adds support for selling surpluses to remote planets with the --mode
parameter (allows either "deficit" or "surplus").  Defaults to deficit if not
specified.

2.1 "Clandestine Clays"
- Adds checks on whether a remote exchange is selling a commodity and if that
is above a certain threshold.
- Improvements to the jump system routine to reduce extra jumps.
- Rank is checked only once instead of every iteration
- Improvements to logging.

2.1.1 "Clandestine Clays"
- Hotfix to resolve company name conflicting with planet name issue.

2.2 "Smuggled Semiconductors"
- Deficits are now checked before leaving planet to purchase them (this should
ensure if someone sold to your planet you don't also try to sell, thereby
buying commodities for no reason).
- Food/fuel will be bought more often.
- Added numerous try/except blocks to improve script runtime.
- Fixed the parsing of exchange data so that it sees less ValueError or 
IndexError exceptions.

2.3 "LanzariK Lozenges"
- Altered exception handling to print exceptions to the logfile.
- Improved verbosity when the checkIfSelling function is used and the remote
exchange is below a certain threshold.
- Updated README with more info on how to run the script.
- Added more logic to end of each iteration so that if a user is not on the
expected planet the script will exit (thus ensuring something bad doesn't 
happen like dying) or if there are extra tons in the cargo hold the script will
not continuously buy more and waste money.
- Closed out old WinError issue which appears to be due to my old crappy wifi
router, not an actual bug in the code.

2.4 "Kurious Katydidics"
- Reduced memory usage by only importing functions needed to run from python
modules.
- Moved all functions to fed_utils.py and dynamic variables to fed_vars.py.

2.5 "Problematic Proteins" 
- Changed update functions so that they no longer write to disk and instead
hold data in memory.
- Added new system and cartel functions for future use cases.
- Renamed a few variables for less confusion later on.
- Further increased speed of script by 50%, finding it stable.

3.0 "Strictly Spices" - Major release
- Fixed issue with player balance not showing correctly.
- Fixed issue with planet treasury not showing correctly.
- Fixed issue with checkLocation function not capturing planet names with
multiple strings, e.g. "Amber Temple".
- Fixed issue where player would occasionally show up on planets they should
not be on.
- New logic for filling deficits on multiple planets owned by player.
